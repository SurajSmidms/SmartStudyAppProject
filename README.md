## 🧠 Why I Built This

As I began learning Android development, I wanted to build a real-world project to apply the concepts I studied.  
**Smart Study** helped me understand the practical implementation of:

- Composable functions and layouts
- State management using `remember` and `mutableStateOf`
- Material theming and UI customization
- Organizing code in a scalable way

This project reflects my learning progress and is the foundation for more advanced apps in the future.
